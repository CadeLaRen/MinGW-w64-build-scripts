Welcome to rubenvb/release. This is where the stable stuff is.

You will find the latest MinGW-w64 GCC toolchains here, which include:
 - GCC: compiler for (obj-)c(++), fortran, 

Currently, there are two major maintained GCC releases:
 - GCC 4.6
 - GCC 4.7

I always recommend using the latest release, for obvious reasons.

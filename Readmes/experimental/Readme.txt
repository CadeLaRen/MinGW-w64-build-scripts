Welcome to rubenvb/experimental. This is where the new and hot stuff is.

For now, this is limited to:
 - 32-bit dw2 GCC 4.6.3
 - Clang which ought to work with above GCC.
 
 To use the above, just download and unzip them to the same directory, so
 "clang" and "gcc" live in the same "mingw32/bin".
 
 For more information on Clang, see http://clang.llvm.org

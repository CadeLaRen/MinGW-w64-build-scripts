Welcome to rubenvb/update where the unnecessary updates reside.

These packages will contain MinGW-w64 updates that provide a new CRT version.

These are ONLY for you IF you know the version you use is buggy and the new
version fixes that bug. Just unzip into your toolchain directory, a lot of
files will be overwritten.

These are completely unnecessary if there are toolchains dated after these
updates, as the new toolchains always contain the latest versions of the CRT.
